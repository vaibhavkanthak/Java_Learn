             * These words cannot be used as identifiers(such as class names, menthod names,
             * and variable names)
             * As they are reserved for specific purposes in java programming language.
             * There are total 53 reserved words in Java
             * Out of which there are 50 keywords and 3 reserved literals.
             * When reserved word is associated with any functionality then it is called as
             * Keyword in Java. And when reserved word is used to represent value then it is
             * called as Reserved Literals(true, false, and null).
             * There are 2 unused keywords in Java (const and goto)
             * There are 48 used keywords in Java.
             * keywords for data types-> byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean,
             * char. (8)
             * keywords for flow control-> if, else, switch, case, default, do, while, for,
             * break, continue, return.(11)
             * keywords for modifiers-> public, private, protected, static, final
             * abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, volatile (11)

             * Keywords for return type-> void. (1)
             * true and false are values for boolean data types.
             * And null is value for Object reference.
             * The remaining used keyword is 'enum' which is used to define a group of named
             * constants.
             *
             * Conclusions->All reserved words in java contains only lower case alphabets.
             * There is no delete keyword in Java because destruction of useless objects is
             * the responsibility of garbage collector.
